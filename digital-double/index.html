                    As its twin curators, we understand the profound experience of having a "double"——counterparts that imitate, learn, influence, and shape one another. As such, we discovered AI not merely as a tool but a "digital double" for users: not just individual users, but the collective us. We contribute personal data, forming a collective pool from which AI systems learn, generalize, and find patterns. In turn, the output we ask for is fed back to us: the faces we generate become our representations; the tasks we automate influence our habits and skills; the strategies and narratives we prompt script our collective reality.

                    <span class="beText">Digital Double</span> invites you to investigate and explore the continuous, cyclical relationship between users and the AI systems. How does our personal data, once contributed to the collective, return to us as a reconfigured reality?

                    We are Zhengyang and Zhengzhou Huang, a twin artist duo based in Chongqing, China, and Los Angeles, US. Our work reimagines our relationship with ever-evolving digital technologies. Using mediums such as animation, games, web, and physical objects, we create stories, interactive applications, speculative designs, and alternative technologies. Essentially, our work joins the never-ending effort to create interfaces and channels that bridge emerging digital phenomena with tangible experiences. We have shown our most recent works at AT HOME, IKEA Residency Closing Show, Fermynwoods Contemporary Art, Society for Literature, Science and the Arts at the University of Michigan, Plicnik Space Initiative, Linda Matney Gallery, etc.
